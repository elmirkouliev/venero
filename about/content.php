    </div>


    <p class="inspiration">Venero is defined as the place where something begins, where it springs into being; the origin. 
    We created Venero as a way for us to express our imagination into fabric. 
    All of our designs gravitate around universal themes to which our audience can relate and feel a connection to. 
    Through ideas of equality, peace, appreciation, and the importance of being you, our motive is reached; as 
    individuality combined with refined focus are ingredients pivotal in tapping into one’s full potential. 
    We believe in providing pieces that reflect such ideas as we explore the depths of our own creativity and style.</p>
